# Free Kanban for BMC ITSM & Custom Applications

Optimize your ITSM flow: work transparent, fast & easy!

Why should you use a kanban board for working with tickets? Most classic ticket tools, like BMC Smart-IT, are using tables for visualizing the tickets in your system. As you can see in the picture below, there's a lack of progress visualization for your tickets.

Further more you can't directly move them to another state, change required fields, and add worklogs, without opening them.

The solution? Kanban Boards. They are the standard tool of agile work - and this for a good reason.

The core concept of Kanban is the optimization of the flow of tasks in your system. Each task should flow through your system with the least amount of drag possible.

Kanban is a workflow management method for defining, managing and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It aims to help you visualize your work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously. (www.kanbanize.com)

Kanban Boards will help you to visualize your worklist and will give you a good overview about your Work In Progress (WIP). Too many Work In Progress tasks can cause massive multitasking and will reduce the implementation speed of the individual tasks. Visualizing them is the first step to reduce them and to optimize your flow.

By using a Kanban board, you can organize your worklist in simple columns. Change the state of a ticket is just as simple as drag and drop.

This way you will not change your focus all the time, and you can work more efficient and faster.
